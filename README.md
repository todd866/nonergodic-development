## The Argument

This paper responds to [Sierra et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adw0685) in *Science Advances*, who proposed the **"Hydra effect"**: cancer as adaptive programmed obsolescence in competitive species. Their data show that cooperative mammals have lower cancer rates than competitive ones.

We offer a more parsimonious explanation: **cancer is an entropic consequence of high-volatility development, not an adaptation**.

Cooperative species don't evolve cancer suppression—they develop in buffered environments that produce fewer cellular bifurcations in the first place. The same developmental coherence that enables social cooperation also stabilizes cellular trajectories, reducing cancer risk as a side effect.

**Occam's Razor:** Don't invoke programmed obsolescence when thermodynamics suffices.

## Abstract

Biological development is a high-dimensional dynamical process that cannot explore its state space in finite time—it is *nonergodic*. We argue that this nonergodicity, combined with low-dimensional genetic anchors, explains why cooperative species exhibit lower cancer rates without requiring adaptive cancer suppression. The genome constrains which regions of developmental state space are reachable, but environmental history determines which attractor basin the system occupies. Cooperative environments buffer developmental noise, reducing the probability of cellular bifurcations (cancer) as an entropic consequence rather than an evolved defense. We formalize this via the **Dimensional Gap** (Δ_D), which quantifies when allele-based and trajectory-based models become non-identifiable from aggregate data.

## AI-Assisted Workflow (Full Transparency)

This paper was developed using an AI-assisted workflow. In the spirit of open science, here's exactly how it worked:

### Primary Drafting: Claude Code (Opus 4.5)

The paper was developed interactively using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Anthropic's CLI tool. The workflow was:

1. **Conceptual discussion:** I described the core argument (development is nonergodic; genomes anchor high-dimensional systems; trajectories determine phenotypes)

2. **Model development:** Claude helped formalize the dimensional gap concept (Δ_D) and write the developmental network simulation

3. **Figure design:** Each figure was designed iteratively:
   - I described what I wanted to show
   - Claude wrote the plotting code
   - We refined panel layouts, colors, and labels through back-and-forth

4. **LaTeX drafting:** Claude drafted sections based on our discussions; I edited and directed revisions

5. **Citation integration:** References to Waddington, Kauffman, Lissek, Rosen, etc. to ground the argument

### Feedback Loop: Gemini 2.5 Pro + GPT o3

After drafting, I fed the paper to Gemini and GPT for critical feedback. This revealed:

- **Notation inconsistencies** (e.g., `k` was overloaded for both trait dimension and environment dimension)
- **Code-text mismatches** (e.g., bias term in equation that wasn't in the code)
- **Missing parameter values** (now explicitly stated in Methods)
- **Figure numbering mismatches** (fixed to match paper order)

Each round of feedback was implemented via Claude Code.

### How many revisions?

At submission, I asked each model to count revision cycles from their conversation history:

| Model | Counted | What they tracked |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| GPT o3 | ~17 cycles (40 turns, 44k words) | Full PDF/TEX/code bundle updates |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | ~38 rounds | Substantive prompt-response pairs |
| Claude Code | ??? | Didn't count, just vibed |

The GPT conversation alone spans from "what is this Sierra paper?" to final submission review—40 user turns covering theory development, multiple reframings, figure iterations, and equation/code consistency checks. Combined with Gemini and Claude Code, the paper went through **100+ total interactions** across all three systems before submission.

### Figure Design Philosophy

The figures were designed to tell a specific story:

| Figure | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Fig 1** | Same genotype → different phenotypes (trajectory divergence) |
| **Fig 2** | Population patterns arise from either mechanism |
| **Fig 3** | Causal DAGs showing structural difference |
| **Fig 4** | Information loss under projection (the dimensional gap) |
| **Fig 5** | "Twin Worlds" - the decisive demonstration |
| **Fig 6** | Where the models diverge (intervention test) |
| **Fig 7** | "Fractal Price" - multilevel selection with Price equation decomposition |
| **Fig 8** | Selection regime comparison - group selection enables cooperation |

Figure 5 is the key result: identical genotype distributions in different environments produce patterns a naive allele model would interpret as genetic differences.

Figures 7-8 extend the model to evolutionary time, showing that the same developmental architecture (coherence) that suppresses cancer also enables social cooperation - a "fractal" structure where the same mechanism operates at multiple scales.

### What the AI Did vs. What I Did

**AI contributed:**
- Code generation (Python simulation, LaTeX formatting)
- Literature search and citation formatting
- Draft text based on my descriptions
- Iterative refinement based on feedback

**I contributed:**
- Core theoretical argument (nonergodicity + anchoring)
- Decisions about what to include/exclude
- Final editing and approval of all content
- Integration with broader research program (this is paper III in a series on dimensional constraints in biology)

## The Model

The developmental network is a continuous-time recurrent neural network treated as a gene regulatory network:

```
dh/dt = -h + tanh(W_h · h + W_e · e_t + W_g · g)
```

Where:
- `g ∈ R^L` is the genotype (L=5, the low-dimensional *anchor*)
- `e_t ∈ R^p` is environmental input at time t (p=3)
- `h_t ∈ R^m` is developmental state (m=20, high-dimensional, *nonergodic*)
- The `-h` term creates intrinsic decay, ensuring relaxation toward attractors

Discretized with Euler's method (dt=0.1). The phenotype is: `x = tanh(W_out · h_T)` (bounded to [-1, 1]).

Cancer mortality emerges via: `μ_S = μ_0(1 - α · c)` where `c` is developmental coherence—how coordinated the trajectory was. Cancer is attractor bifurcation: cells diverging from the organismal trajectory.

## Multilevel Simulation (Fractal Cooperation)

The `multilevel_simulation.py` extends the model to evolutionary time with explicit multilevel selection:

- **Organisms** develop phenotypes via the developmental network
- **Groups** provide the developmental environment (more cooperative groups → more stable environments)
- **Selection** operates at both levels: between-group (cooperative groups outcompete) and within-group (individuals compete)

The **Price equation** decomposes selection into:
- `S_between`: Selection due to group differences (favors cooperation)
- `S_within`: Selection due to individual differences (can favor defection)

Key finding: **The same coherence parameter (c) that suppresses cancer also drives cooperation**. This is "fractal" because the same dynamical structure (high-D development + low-D anchor → attractor trapping) operates at multiple scales:
- Cells cooperating within organisms (coherence prevents cancer)
- Organisms cooperating within groups (coherence creates stable environment)

## Key Results

### 1. Twin Worlds (Non-identifiability)

![Twin Worlds Experiment](figures/fig5_twin_worlds.png)

**Proposition 1:** For any allele-based mortality pattern {μ, μ+δ}, there exists an environment pair that produces identical patterns via trajectory-based mechanisms. The models are distinguishable only through intervention experiments.

### 2. Fractal Cooperation

The same coherence parameter `c` that suppresses cancer also enables cooperation:
- **Within organisms:** Coherent development prevents cellular bifurcations (cancer)
- **Between organisms:** Cooperative groups create stable developmental environments

This is "fractal" because the same mechanism—attractor trapping in high-dimensional systems—operates at multiple scales.

### Implications

- Some "missing heritability" in GWAS may be missing trajectory information, not missing variants
- The Dimensional Gap (Δ_D) quantifies information lost when projecting from (anchor, trajectory, attractor) to (genotype, phenotype)
- Sierra et al.'s data are consistent with our model: cooperation → buffered development → fewer bifurcations → less cancer
