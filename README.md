## Abstract

Biological development is a high-dimensional dynamical process that cannot explore its state space in finite time—it is *nonergodic*. We argue that this nonergodicity, combined with low-dimensional genetic anchors, is the fundamental reason why genotype does not algorithmically determine phenotype. The genome constrains which regions of developmental state space are reachable, but environmental history determines which attractor basin the system occupies. We formalize this via the **Dimensional Gap** (Δ_D), which quantifies when allele-based and trajectory-based models become non-identifiable from aggregate data.

## AI-Assisted Workflow (Full Transparency)

This paper was developed using an AI-assisted workflow. In the spirit of open science, here's exactly how it worked:

### Primary Drafting: Claude Code (Claude 4.5 Opus)

The paper was developed interactively using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Anthropic's CLI tool. The workflow was:

1. **Conceptual discussion:** I described the core argument (development is nonergodic; genomes anchor high-dimensional systems; trajectories determine phenotypes)

2. **Model development:** Claude helped formalize the dimensional gap concept (Δ_D) and write the developmental network simulation

3. **Figure design:** Each figure was designed iteratively:
   - I described what I wanted to show
   - Claude wrote the plotting code
   - We refined panel layouts, colors, and labels through back-and-forth

4. **LaTeX drafting:** Claude drafted sections based on our discussions; I edited and directed revisions

5. **Citation integration:** References to Waddington, Kauffman, Lissek, Rosen, etc. to ground the argument

### Feedback Loop: Gemini 3 Pro + GPT 5.1 Pro

After drafting, I fed the paper to Gemini and GPT for critical feedback. This revealed:

- **Notation inconsistencies** (e.g., `k` was overloaded for both trait dimension and environment dimension)
- **Code-text mismatches** (e.g., bias term in equation that wasn't in the code)
- **Missing parameter values** (now explicitly stated in Methods)
- **Figure numbering mismatches** (fixed to match paper order)

Each round of feedback was implemented via Claude Code.

### Figure Design Philosophy

The figures were designed to tell a specific story:

| Figure | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Fig 1** | Same genotype → different phenotypes (trajectory divergence) |
| **Fig 2** | Population patterns arise from either mechanism |
| **Fig 3** | Causal DAGs showing structural difference |
| **Fig 4** | Information loss under projection (the dimensional gap) |
| **Fig 5** | "Twin Worlds" - the decisive demonstration |
| **Fig 6** | Where the models diverge (intervention test) |

Figure 5 is the key result: identical genotype distributions in different environments produce patterns a naive allele model would interpret as genetic differences.

### What the AI Did vs. What I Did

**AI contributed:**
- Code generation (Python simulation, LaTeX formatting)
- Literature search and citation formatting
- Draft text based on my descriptions
- Iterative refinement based on feedback

**I contributed:**
- Core theoretical argument (nonergodicity + anchoring)
- Decisions about what to include/exclude
- Final editing and approval of all content
- Integration with broader research program (this is paper III in a series on dimensional constraints in biology)

## The Model

The developmental network is a recurrent neural network treated as a gene regulatory network:

```
h_{t+1} = tanh(W_h · h_t + W_e · e_t + W_g · g)
```

Where:
- `g ∈ R^L` is the genotype (L=5, the low-dimensional *anchor*)
- `e_t ∈ R^p` is environmental input at time t (p=3)
- `h_t ∈ R^m` is developmental state (m=20, high-dimensional, *nonergodic*)

The phenotype is a linear readout: `x = W_out · h_T`

Cancer mortality emerges via: `μ_S = μ_0(1 - α · r)` where `r` is repair allocation extracted from the phenotype.

## Key Result

![Twin Worlds Experiment](figures/fig5_twin_worlds.png)

**Proposition 1 (Non-identifiability):** For any allele-based mortality pattern {μ, μ+δ}, there exists an environment pair that produces identical patterns via trajectory-based mechanisms. The models are distinguishable only through intervention experiments.

**The core insight:** Missing heritability in GWAS is not missing variants—it is missing trajectory information. The dimensional gap Δ_D quantifies how much information is lost when we project from (anchor, trajectory, attractor) to (genotype, phenotype).
