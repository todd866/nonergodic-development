## Abstract

The assumption that genotype algorithmically determines phenotype underlies much of evolutionary modeling. We prove this framing is incomplete: when phenotype emerges from low-dimensional genetic parameters passing through a high-dimensional developmental system, allele-based and plasticity-based models become *non-identifiable* from typical observational data.

## AI-Assisted Workflow (Full Transparency)

This paper was developed using an AI-assisted workflow. In the spirit of open science, here's exactly how it worked:

### Primary Drafting: Claude Code (Claude 4.5 Opus)

The paper was developed interactively using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Anthropic's CLI tool. The workflow was:

1. **Conceptual discussion:** I described the core argument (genotype provides parameters to a high-dimensional developmental system; allele stories are non-identifiable from plasticity mechanisms)

2. **Model development:** Claude helped formalize the dimensional gap concept (ΔD) and write the developmental network simulation

3. **Figure design:** Each figure was designed iteratively:
   - I described what I wanted to show
   - Claude wrote the plotting code
   - We refined panel layouts, colors, and labels through back-and-forth

4. **LaTeX drafting:** Claude drafted sections based on our discussions; I edited and directed revisions

5. **Citation integration:** We added ~18 references (Pigliucci, West-Eberhard, Waddington, Kauffman, etc.) to ground the argument in existing literature

### Feedback Loop: Gemini 3 Pro + GPT 5.1 Pro

After drafting, I fed the paper to Gemini and GPT for critical feedback. This revealed:

- **Notation inconsistencies** (e.g., `k` was overloaded for both trait dimension and environment dimension)
- **Code-text mismatches** (e.g., bias term in equation that wasn't in the code)
- **Missing parameter values** (now explicitly stated in §3.3)
- **Weak section transitions** (added explanatory text)

Each round of feedback was implemented via Claude Code.

### Figure Design Philosophy

The figures were designed to tell a specific story:

| Figure | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Fig 1** | Same genotype → different phenotypes (the core claim) |
| **Fig 2** | Population patterns arise from either mechanism |
| **Fig 3** | Information loss under projection (why we can't tell) |
| **Fig 4** | Where the models diverge (intervention predictions) |
| **Fig 5** | Causal DAGs showing structural difference |
| **Fig 6** | "Twin Worlds" - the decisive demonstration |

Figure 6 is the key result: identical genotype distributions in different environments produce patterns a naive allele model would interpret as genetic differences.

### What the AI Did vs. What I Did

**AI contributed:**
- Code generation (Python simulation, LaTeX formatting)
- Literature search and citation formatting
- Draft text based on my descriptions
- Iterative refinement based on feedback

**I contributed:**
- Core theoretical argument
- Decisions about what to include/exclude
- Final editing and approval of all content
- Integration with broader research program (this is paper III in a series on dimensional constraints in biology)

## The Model

The developmental network is a recurrent neural network treated as a gene regulatory network:

```
h_{t+1} = tanh(W_h · h_t + W_e · e_t + W_g · g)
```

Where:
- `g ∈ R^L` is the genotype (L=5, low-dimensional)
- `e_t ∈ R^p` is environmental input at time t (p=3)
- `h_t ∈ R^m` is developmental state (m=20, high-dimensional)

The phenotype is a linear readout: `x = W_out · h_T`

Cancer mortality emerges via: `μ_S = μ_0(1 - α·r)` where `r` is repair allocation extracted from the phenotype.

## Key Result

**Proposition 1 (Non-identifiability):** For any allele-based mortality pattern {μ, μ+δ}, there exists an environment pair that produces identical patterns via plasticity. The models are distinguishable only through intervention experiments.
