\opening{Dear Professor Igamberdiev,}

I am pleased to submit ``Genotype $\neq$ Phenotype: High-Dimensional Development, Plasticity, and the Limits of Allele Stories'' for consideration in \emph{BioSystems}.

This manuscript provides a mathematical formalization of a debate currently active in this journal. Lissek (2024, \emph{BioSystems} 247) recently proposed that malignancy can arise from ``cancer memory''---a form of physiological learning---rather than purely from clonal mutation. Our work supplies the information-theoretic dual to this biological argument: we prove that when phenotype emerges from low-dimensional genetic parameters passing through a high-dimensional developmental system, allele-based and plasticity-based models become \textbf{formally non-identifiable} from aggregate observational data.

The paper introduces the ``Dimensional Gap'' ($\Delta_D$), which quantifies when this non-identifiability arises, and demonstrates it through a minimal developmental network model. Our ``Twin Worlds'' experiment shows that identical genotype distributions in different environments produce patterns a naive allele model would misinterpret as genetic differences---with $F_{ST} \approx 0$ yet $P_{ST} \gg 0$. This directly explains why ``missing heritability'' in GWAS studies may reflect projection artifacts rather than missing variants.

The work responds to Sierra et al.\ (2025, \emph{Science Advances}), who documented lower cancer prevalence in cooperative mammalian species and modeled this as allele-based selection. We show their finding is equally consistent with plastic developmental policies responding to cooperative environmental cues---a distinction with significant implications for intervention strategies.

This submission continues a research program on dimensional constraints in biology previously published in \emph{BioSystems}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Todd (2025a): ``The limits of falsifiability'' (DOI: 10.1016/j.biosystems.2025.105608)
    \item Todd (2025b): ``Timing inaccessibility and the projection bound'' (DOI: 10.1016/j.biosystems.2025.105632)
\end{itemize}

In the tradition of Rosen's critique of algorithmic biology, we demonstrate that the gene-as-algorithm assumption is not merely an approximation but a projection that actively discards causal structure.

The manuscript engages directly with recent \emph{BioSystems} publications including Lee et al.\ (2022) on phenotypic plasticity, Letsou (2024) on temporal structure in development, Corning (2022) on systems evolution, and Fontana (2023) on the development-ageing-cancer nexus. We believe it will be of strong interest to the journal's readership.

\closing{Thank you for your consideration.}
